The code is on github at the following link: https://github.gatech.edu/mpandiri3/4641Projects/tree/master/Project%201

There are two folders for each dataset and each folder has the code and data for the specific dataset

The Data
- The preprocessed data has already been included - some of the modifications are listed in the report
- Thus none of the code for preprocessing is needed. I have included the preprocessing code in case - preProcess.ipynb

The Code
- Make sure to have the following libraries
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- sklearn
	- random
	- itertools
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- io
	- scipy
	- time
- Run the jupyter notebooks
	- AllAlgorithmsFinalOlympics.ipynb
	- AllAlgorithmsFinalNursing.ipynb

The Analysis
	- The analysis for the data is in mpandiri3-analysis.pdf
