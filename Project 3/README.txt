The code is on github at the following link: https://github.com/mukundSai/4641Projects/tree/master/Project%203


The Data
- The preprocessed data has already been included (finalDataNursing.csv, finalDataOlympics.csv)
- Thus none of the code for preprocessing is needed. I have included the preprocessing code in case - preProcess.ipynb

The Code
- Make sure to have the following libraries
	- pandas
	- numpy
	- sklearn
	- random
	- itertools
	- matplotlib
	- seaborn
	- io
	- scipy
	- time
	- mlrose
- Run the jupyter notebooks
	- Clustering.ipynb  - Note each section has the file name for importing. Make sure to change the name of the file that needs to be imported and run accordingly

The Analysis
	- The analysis for the data is in mpandiri3-analysis.pdf
